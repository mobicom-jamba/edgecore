# This is a placeholder for the Montserrat Medium font file
# In a real project, you would download the actual font file from Google Fonts
# or another font provider and place it here.
#
# To get the actual font:
# 1. Go to https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat
# 2. Download the font family
# 3. Extract and place Montserrat-Medium.ttf here
#
# For now, the app will fall back to system fonts.
