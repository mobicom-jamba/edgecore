# This is a placeholder for the app icon
# In a real project, you would create or commission a proper app icon
# following the design guidelines:
# - Navy surface (#12161F)
# - Warm teal crescent (#5ED0B5)
# - Soft glow effect
# - Night-safe design
#
# Icon sizes needed:
# - Android: 48x48, 72x72, 96x96, 144x144, 192x192dp
# - iOS: 20x20, 29x29, 40x40, 58x58, 60x60, 80x80, 87x87, 120x120, 180x180pt
# - Web: 192x192, 512x512px
#
# For now, the app will use the default Flutter launcher icon.
