# This is a placeholder for the onboarding illustration
# In a real project, you would create or commission illustrations
# that follow the app's design principles:
# - Night-first visual ergonomics
# - Warm/neutral accents
# - Minimal, calming imagery
# - Consistent with the sleep theme
#
# Suggested illustrations:
# - Peaceful bedroom scene
# - Moon and stars
# - Gentle abstract patterns
# - Sleep-related icons
#
# For now, the app will use built-in icons and text.
